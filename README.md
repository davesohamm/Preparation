## 📅 15 May 2025

- ✅ Solved LeetCode Problem [2900. Longest Unequal Adjacent Groups Subsequence I](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-unequal-adjacent-groups-subsequence-i/description/) Achieved 100 Days badge with 143 problems solved today! 🪙

  <p align="center"><img src="leetcode100days.png" alt="100 Days Streak" width="250" /></p>

- 📚 Studied:
  - Graph Theory from Physics Wallah Lecture, where I learnt :
  - 1. Introduction:
    Graph theory is essential in math and computer science, studied through logic, set theory, and combinatorics.
  - 2. History:
    Originated in 1736 with a problem about visiting locations—birth of graph theory.
  - 3. Basic Definitions:
    A graph = vertices (nodes) + edges (connections).
    Directed graphs use ordered pairs; undirected use unordered.
  - 4. Key Concepts:
    Self-loops: edge connects a vertex to itself.
    Parallel edges: multiple edges between the same vertices.
    Degree: number of edges connected to a vertex.
  - 5. Important Theorems:
    Sum of all vertex degrees = 2 × number of edges.
    Pendant vertex: degree 1. Isolated vertex: degree 0.
  - 6. Types of Graphs:
    Simple, multi, and pseudo graphs, each with specific rules.
    Max degree in a simple graph = n – 1.
  - 7. Applications:
    Used in solving real-world problems, especially in algorithms and computing.
  - 8. Advanced Topics:
    Includes directed graphs, graph complexity, and computational methods.
  - 9. Graph Limits:
    Understanding vertex/edge limits helps in valid graph construction.

That's it for the day! **Bye ❤️**

## 📅 16 & 17 May 2025

- ✅ Solved LeetCode Problem [2901. Longest Unequal Adjacent Groups Subsequence II](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-unequal-adjacent-groups-subsequence-ii/description/) & [75. Sort Colors](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-colors/description/).

- 📚 Studied:
  - Set Theory & Discrete Math Concepts, where I learnt:

  - 1. Set Theory Basics:
    A set is a collection of distinct elements.  
    Types: finite, infinite, null (∅), universal (U), singleton.

  - 2. Subset:
    A ⊆ B ⇒ all elements of A are in B.  
    Proper subset: A ⊂ B, A ≠ B.  
    **Formulas**:  
    - Subsets = 2ⁿ  
    - Proper subsets = 2ⁿ – 1

  - 3. Power Set:
    The set of all subsets of A, denoted P(A).  
    **Size**: |P(A)| = 2ⁿ

  - 4. Relation, Domain, Range:
    A relation R ⊆ A × B.  
    - **Domain**: all first elements  
    - **Range**: all second elements

  - 5. Equivalence Relation:
    A relation that is:
    - **Reflexive**: aRa  
    - **Symmetric**: aRb ⇒ bRa  
    - **Transitive**: aRb ∧ bRc ⇒ aRc  
    Results in **partitions** of the set.

  - 6. Partial Order Relation:
    A relation that is:
    - **Reflexive**  
    - **Antisymmetric**: aRb ∧ bRa ⇒ a = b  
    - **Transitive**

  - 7. POSET (Partially Ordered Set):
    A set with a partial order relation.  
    Not all elements are comparable.

  - 8. TOSET (Totally Ordered Set):
    A POSET where every pair is comparable.  
    Example: Natural numbers with “≤”.

  - 9. Hasse Diagram:
    Visual representation of a POSET.  
    - Omits reflexive and transitive edges.  
    - Drawn bottom-up (least to greatest).
    - **Minimal element**: no element below it.  
    - **Maximal element**: no element above it.  
    - **Greatest Lower Bound (GLB)**: largest element ≤ all selected elements.  
    - **Least Upper Bound (LUB)**: smallest element ≥ all selected elements.

  - 10. Pigeonhole Principle:
    If n items in m containers and n > m, at least one has ≥ 2 items.  
    **Generalized**: At least one has ⌈n/m⌉ items.

That's it! **Bye ❤️**
