# Preparation
## 📅 12 May 2025

- ✅ Solved LeetCode Problems [2094. Finding 3-Digit Even Numbers](https://leetcode.com/problems/finding-3-digit-even-numbers/) & [242. Valid Anagram](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-anagram/). Used the same concept in both of them - `Counter()` method. It functions as a dictionary where keys are elements and values are their counts.
- 📘 Worked on DAIICT sample paper (see `DAIICT Paper.pdf` in the repo)
  - Completed: Half of the paper
  - Plan: Remaining half to be completed tomorrow
  - Solved paper: `DAIICT Solution 1.pdf`
- 🚗 Car Driving Practice (5:30 PM)
  - Learnt reverse parking and reverse 8-loop
  - Drove in traffic for some time
  - Papa mentioned I need more confidence and practice
- 📚 Studied:

## 📅 15 May 2025

- ✅ Solved LeetCode Problem [2900. Longest Unequal Adjacent Groups Subsequence I](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-unequal-adjacent-groups-subsequence-i/description/) Achieved 100 Days badge with 143 problems solved today! 🪙

</p>
- 📚 Studied:
  - Graph Theory from Physics Wallah Lecture, where I learnt :
      1. Introduction:
        Graph theory is essential in math and computer science, studied through logic, set theory, and combinatorics.
      2. History:
        Originated in 1736 with a problem about visiting locations—birth of graph theory.
      3. Basic Definitions:
        A graph = vertices (nodes) + edges (connections).
        Directed graphs use ordered pairs; undirected use unordered.
      4. Key Concepts:
        Self-loops: edge connects a vertex to itself.
        Parallel edges: multiple edges between the same vertices.
        Degree: number of edges connected to a vertex.
      5. Important Theorems:
        Sum of all vertex degrees = 2 × number of edges.
        Pendant vertex: degree 1. Isolated vertex: degree 0.
      6. Types of Graphs:
        Simple, multi, and pseudo graphs, each with specific rules.
        Max degree in a simple graph = n – 1.
      7. Applications:
        Used in solving real-world problems, especially in algorithms and computing.
      8. Advanced Topics:
        Includes directed graphs, graph complexity, and computational methods.
      9. Graph Limits:
        Understanding vertex/edge limits helps in valid graph construction.

That's it the first day! **Bye ❤️**
