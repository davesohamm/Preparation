    - **Symmetric**: aRb ⇒ bRa  
    - **Transitive**: aRb ∧ bRc ⇒ aRc  
    Results in **partitions** of the set.

  - 6. Partial Order Relation:
    A relation that is:

## 📅 Till 2 June 2025

- ✅ Solved 28 LeetCode Problems including 12 problems from FRAZ DSA sheet.
- 📚 Studied:
  
### Warshall's Algorithm
Warshall's algorithm is used to compute the transitive closure of a directed graph.  
It determines whether there is a path between every pair of vertices.

### Equivalence Relation
A relation is an equivalence relation if it is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive.  
It partitions a set into disjoint equivalence classes.

### Bijective, Injective, Surjective
An injective function maps distinct inputs to distinct outputs.  
A surjective function covers every output value; bijective does both.

### Inverse Function
An inverse function reverses the effect of the original function.  
It exists only for bijective functions.

### Null Graph
A null graph has vertices but no edges.  
All vertices are isolated.

### Trivial Graph
A trivial graph contains only a single vertex and no edges.  
It is the simplest form of a graph.

### Complete Graph
A complete graph connects every pair of distinct vertices with an edge.  
It is denoted by \( K_n \) with \( \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \) edges.

### Degree of a Vertex
The degree of a vertex is the number of edges incident to it.  
In a directed graph, we have in-degree and out-degree.

### Handshaking Theorem
The sum of degrees of all vertices in an undirected graph is twice the number of edges.  
It’s derived from counting handshakes between people.

### Bipartite Graph
A graph is bipartite if vertices can be divided into two disjoint sets with no edges within a set.  
Edges only connect vertices from different sets.

### Complete Bipartite Graph
It’s a bipartite graph where every vertex from one set is connected to all in the other set.  
Denoted as \( K_{m,n} \).

### Regular Graph
A graph is regular if all its vertices have the same degree.  
It can be k-regular if each vertex has degree k.

### Walk, Open Walk, Closed Walk, Path
A walk is a sequence of vertices and edges; it may repeat vertices and edges.  
An open walk starts and ends at different vertices; a closed walk starts and ends at the same vertex; a path has no repeated vertices.

### Connected Graph
A graph is connected if there is a path between every pair of vertices.  
If not, it is disconnected.

### Euler Graph
An Euler graph has an Euler cycle that uses every edge exactly once.  
A connected graph has an Euler cycle if all vertices have even degree.

### Euler Walk/Cycle
An Euler walk uses every edge exactly once and may start/end at different vertices.  
An Euler cycle is a closed Euler walk.

### Hamiltonian Graph
A Hamiltonian graph contains a cycle that visits every vertex exactly once.  
Unlike Eulerian, it focuses on vertices instead of edges.

### Hamiltonian Walk/Cycle
A Hamiltonian walk visits each vertex exactly once.  
If it starts and ends at the same vertex, it is a Hamiltonian cycle.

### Planar Graph
A graph is planar if it can be drawn without edge crossings.  
Kuratowski’s Theorem helps identify non-planar graphs.

### Euler's Formula \( R = E - V + 2 \)
In a connected planar graph, the number of regions (R) = Edges (E) - Vertices (V) + 2.  
This formula helps verify planarity.

### Tree
A tree is an acyclic connected graph.  
It has \( n-1 \) edges for \( n \) vertices.

### Eccentricity
Eccentricity of a vertex is the greatest distance between it and any other vertex.  
It helps determine graph centers.

### Spanning Tree
A spanning tree connects all vertices with the minimum number of edges and no cycles.  
Every connected graph has at least one spanning tree.

### Rank and Nullity
Rank is the number of edges in a spanning tree; nullity is the number of cycles.  
For a graph with \( e \) edges and \( v \) vertices, nullity = \( e - (v - 1) \).

### Branch and Chords
In a spanning tree, branches are edges in the tree; chords are edges not in the tree.  
Chords create cycles when added to the tree.

### Edge Cut Sets
An edge cut set is a set of edges whose removal disconnects the graph.  
It is used in network reliability.

### Vertex Cut Sets
A vertex cut set is a set of vertices whose removal disconnects the graph.  
It identifies critical points in the network.

### Matching
A matching is a set of edges without common vertices.  
It pairs elements from one set to another.

### Maximal Matching
A maximal matching is a matching that cannot be extended by adding more edges.  
It is not necessarily the largest possible.

### Maximum Matching
A maximum matching is a matching with the largest possible number of edges.  
It may or may not be unique.

### Perfect Matching
A perfect matching covers all vertices such that every vertex is matched.  
Only possible if the number of vertices is even.

### Line Covering
A line covering is a set of lines (edges) covering all vertices.  
It relates to matching problems.

### Minimal Line Covering
A minimal line covering uses the smallest number of edges to cover all vertices.  
It often complements maximum matching.

### Minimum Line Covering
It’s the least number of lines (edges) needed to cover all vertices.  
It’s used in optimization problems.

### Independent Line Sets
Independent line sets contain edges with no shared vertices.  
They form the basis of matchings.

### Vertex Covering
A vertex cover is a set of vertices such that every edge is incident to at least one vertex.  
Finding the minimum vertex cover is NP-complete.

### Graph Theory
Graph theory studies graphs: structures made of nodes (vertices) and links (edges).  
It is widely used in computer science, biology, and social networks.

### Closure
Closure of a set under an operation means performing the operation always results in an element of the same set.  
It is a property in algebraic structures.

### Algebraic Structure
An algebraic structure consists of a set with one or more operations.  
Examples include groups, rings, and fields.

### Associative
An operation is associative if \( (a * b) * c = a * (b * c) \).  
Associativity is required in semigroups and groups.

### Semigroup
A semigroup is a set with an associative binary operation.  
It need not have an identity or inverse.

### Identity
An identity element leaves other elements unchanged under an operation.  
For addition, 0 is the identity; for multiplication, 1 is.

### Monoid
A monoid is a semigroup with an identity element.  
It still may lack inverses.

### Inverse
An inverse element undoes the effect of the operation.  
For each \( a \), there exists \( b \) such that \( a * b = \text{identity} \).

### Group
A group is a set with an associative operation, identity, and inverses.  
Groups form the foundation of abstract algebra.

### Commutative
An operation is commutative if \( a * b = b * a \).  
Addition and multiplication of numbers are examples.

### Abelian Group
An Abelian group is a group with a commutative operation.  
Named after mathematician Niels Abel.

### Finite Group
A finite group has a finite number of elements.  
Its size is called the order of the group.

### Order of Group
The order of a group is the number of its elements.  
In cyclic groups, the order of an element divides the group order.

### Graph Coloring
Graph coloring assigns colors to vertices so that adjacent ones have different colors.  
It helps solve scheduling and map coloring problems.

### Proper Vertex Coloring
A proper coloring ensures no two adjacent vertices share the same color.  
Minimum number of colors is the graph's chromatic number.

### Chromatic Number
The chromatic number is the smallest number of colors needed for proper vertex coloring.  
It varies with graph structure.
